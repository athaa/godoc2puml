godoc2puml
==========
This project is project is a fork from original unmaintained project https://github.com/t-yuki/godoc2puml.

The fork has been necessary because of the original project depends on depency which do not exists anymore (updated from "golang.org/x/tools/oracle" to "github.com/visualfc/gotools/oracle/oracle").
It additionnally update the relation type to not force the orientation of the relation and let the "IA" chose the best way (usage of --> instead of ->).

godoc2puml converts godoc formatted documentation into plantuml format. 

Installation
------------

Just type the following to install the program:

    $ go get -u github.com/athaa/godoc2puml

If you want to draw a diagram as a image file, it depends on java and graphviz. you must install them:

    $ sudo yum install java graphviz
    $ # or, etc...
    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless graphviz

It also depends on plantuml. <del>Well, it is already attached so you do not need to install separately.</del>

Usage
-----

`godoc2puml` generates a diagram for packages. You can also specify output format if you installed the above.

    $ godoc2puml net/http > net.http.puml
    $ java -jar plantuml.jar -pipe -tpng < net.http.puml > net.http.png

    $ # NOT IMPLEMENTED YET # godoc2puml -t=png net/http > net.http.png

Other options:

```
Usage of godoc2puml:
  -dont-ignore string
        white-list for ignore. default/empty value means packages of arg
  -field string
        set package names in comma-separated strings that use field relationship instead of association
  -h    show this help
  -ignore string
        name filter to ignore. default value removes fmt.String and private declarations except specified packages (default "(fmt\\.Stringer|\\w+\\.[a-z][\\w]*)$")
  -lolipop string
        set package names in comma-separated strings that use lolipop-style interface relationship instead of implementation
  -scope string
        set analysis scope (main) package. if it is omitted, scope is tests in the same directory
  -t string
        output format
        puml:  write PlantUML format (default "text")
```

Many, but...

* enum pattern is not recognized

* cant parse array- or nested-pointer- embed structs

* ...
